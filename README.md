# Sentiments-Analysis-on-toxic-comments-using-ML-algorithms
This research project was done as a part of my MSc in Business Analytics thesis at the University of Kent, UK. 

The project involved exploring various Machine Learning techniques to detect and analyze toxic comments on online platforms. My study focused on examining different algorithms to assess their effectiveness in sentiment analysis, and ultimately aiming to identify the best approaches for recognizing and filtering toxic content in online forums.

Algorithms used:- Logistic Regression, Random Forest classifier, Decision tree classifier, K-nearest neighbour and SVC (Support Vector Classifier), KNN, and Neural Networks (ROC curve)

Optimized the ROC Curve
